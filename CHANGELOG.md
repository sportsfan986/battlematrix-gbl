# SilphScope PvP Changelog

## [v3.22] — 2026-10-22 — Top-100 Role-Weighted Anti-Meta Team Builder, 3-Slot Alternate Moveset Simulation, Key Wins / Key Threats / Core Breakers & Top-25 SilphScope Meta Audit
- **Top-100 Flattened Role-Weighted Synthetic Meta Blended with Season Logs (`gblData.ts`, `OverlayService.kt`)**:
  - Upgraded the Anti-Meta Team Builder (`ABB` / `ABC`) to build and score all candidate lineups (`Core BR`, `Lead BR`, `Swap BR`, `Closer BR`) against a **Top-100 flattened synthetic meta** ($\exp(-0.022 \cdot i)$) weighted heaviest on the most common Pokémon for each role (`Lead`, `Safe Swap`, `Closer`) and blended with your current-season battle logs (`wHist` + `wMeta`).
  - Expanded the candidate team generation pool to the **Top 60+ Meta Pokémon** per league while enforcing GBL species-clause and Mega Master League constraints.
- **`Beats X/25 Top Meta` Target Depth & Bottom Top 25 SilphScope Meta Reference Card (`App.tsx`, `MainActivity.kt`, `gblData.ts`, `OverlayService.kt`)**:
  - Increased the Top Meta target audit depth displayed on each generated ABB and ABC team card from `/15` to **`/25` (`Beats X/25 Top Meta`)**.
  - Added a **"🎯 Top 25 <League> Meta Determined by SilphScope (Target Audit Pool for /25 Wins)"** reference section at the bottom of the Anti-Meta Team Builder card listing `#1` through `#25` with species name and field weight percentage (`%`).
- **3-Slot Alternate Moveset Simulation & `⚡ Alt Moveset` Highlighting**:
  - Simulates legal Fast + Charged move combinations across all 3 team members on top ABB and ABC candidate lineups against the Top-100 role-weighted meta.
  - Highlights any non-standard moveset on generated team cards with an **`⚡ Alt Moveset (+X BR)`** badge, violet move name styling, and a comparison to the standard PvPoke moveset, and carries those optimized moves directly into the Edit Team modal on selection.
- **Key Wins, Key Threats & Core Breakers Breakdown**:
  - Every generated ABB and ABC team card now displays **`✅ Key Wins`**, **`⚠️ Key Threats`** (Top-25 Pokémon that beat your Lead and pressure your backline), and **`🚨 Core Breakers`** (Top-25 Pokémon that beat all 3 team members `BR < 490`) in both the visual breakdown badges and the team synergy description.

## [v3.21] — 2026-10-22 — Native Android & Web Anti-Meta Team Builder (`ABB` / `ABC`) on Team Presets Page
- **Anti-Meta Team Builder on Team Presets Page (`MainActivity.kt`, `OverlayService.kt`, `activity_main.xml`, `App.tsx`, `gblData.ts`)**:
  - **2a — League & Featured Pokémon Selection**: Added an **Anti-Meta Team Builder (`ABB` / `ABC`)** panel and header button (`🧪 Anti-Meta`) directly on the **Team Presets** page where you can select any **League** (`GREAT LEAGUE`, `ULTRA LEAGUE`, `MASTER LEAGUE`, `MEGA MASTER LEAGUE`) and enter **0, 1, or 2 Featured Pokémon** with live autocomplete and GBL species-clause checks.
  - **2b — Best 5 ABB & Best 5 ABC Team Options**: Generates and ranks the **Best 5 ABB** and **Best 5 ABC** anti-meta team options that must include your selected Featured Pokémon, displaying `Core BR`, `Lead BR`, `Swap BR`, `Closer BR`, and key Top-Meta targets countered.
  - **2c — One-Tap Team Creation & Immediate Edit Screen**: Selecting any generated ABB or ABC option creates the team with the default name **`<LeagueAbbreviation> Anti-Meta <YYYY-MM-DD>`** (e.g., `GL Anti-Meta 2026-10-22`) and immediately opens the **Edit Team** screen (`showPresetEditorDialog` / `openEditPresetModal`) so you can customize moves, IVs, or role upgrades like any other team.

## [v3.20] — 2026-10-22 — Top-200 Precomputed 9x9 Overlay Shield Matrix, Anti-Meta Team Builder (ABB/ABC) & Special Mechanics Validator Audit
- **Precomputed 9x9 Shield Matrix for Active Team vs. Top-200 League Meta (`gblData.ts`, `App.tsx`, `OverlayService.kt`)**:
  - Precomputes the full 9x9 weighted move-combo shield matrix (`0v0` through `2v2`) for the 3 members of the active team against the **Top 200 League Meta** before launching the overlay (and automatically on team/league switch).
  - Real-time overlay battling now serves Top-200 meta matchups in **O(1) time** from the precomputed 9x9 matrix cache, while falling back to fast single-moveset real-time rough math (`evaluateFastRoughShieldBattleRating` / `calculateFastRoughMatchupRatingStatic`) for non-Top-200 spice matchups.
- **Anti-Meta Team Builder on Team Presets Page (`generateAntiMetaTeamOptions` & `App.tsx`)**:
  - **2a**: Select any **League** and enter **0, 1, or 2 Featured Pokémon** (with live autocomplete and GBL species-clause validation).
  - **2b**: Generates and ranks the **Best 5 ABB** and **Best 5 ABC** anti-meta team options that must include your selected Featured Pokémon, displaying `Core BR`, `Lead BR`, `Swap BR`, `Closer BR`, and key Top-Meta targets countered.
  - **2c**: Selecting any generated ABB or ABC team option creates the preset with default name **`<LeagueAbbreviation> Anti-Meta <YYYY-MM-DD>`** (e.g., `GL Anti-Meta 2026-10-22`) and immediately opens the **Edit Team** modal so you can customize moves, IVs, or role upgrades like any other team.
- **Special Mechanics Math Validator & Double-Bonus Elimination (`FORM_CHANGE_SPECIAL_POKEMON`, `gblData.ts`, `OverlayService.kt`)**:
  - Scoped the Special Mechanics Math Validator exclusively to Pokémon with **in-battle special mechanics**: **Morpeko** (`Hunger Switch` + `Aura Wheel`), **Cramorant** (`Gulp Missile` Gulping/Gorging forms), **Aegislash** (`Stance Change` Shield ⇄ Blade Forme), and **Mimikyu** (`Disguise` + Busted Form). Removed static pre-battle form Pokémon (`Zygarde`, `Giratina`, `Palkia`, `Dialga`, `Zacian`, `Zamazenta`, `Necrozma`, `Kyurem`, `Mewtwo`, `Deoxys`).
  - Eliminated double-bonus multipliers (`Aegislash` `2.85x -> 1.22x` Stance Change factor and duplicate flat BR deltas) so Aegislash Shield Forme is no longer artificially inflated in Team Builder or Overlay matrices.
  - Strictly sourced all Top-Meta pools and Top-5 DB Scores from live PvPoke rankings (`1500` / `2500` / `10000`) rather than static Gamemaster order.

## [v3.16] — 2026-10-22 — Strict Legal Move Pool Enforcement & Dynamic Alternate Move-Combo Matrix Normalization
- **Strict Legal Move Pool Enforcement & Audit (`OverlayService.kt` & `gblData.ts`)**:
  - Eliminated illegal moves from species pools (e.g. Mimikyu only learns `Play Rough`, `Shadow Sneak`, `Thunder` in Pokémon GO — fixed invalid `Shadow Ball` recommendations; Cramorant fast moves are `Peck` / `Water Gun` and charged moves `Surf` / `Fly` / `Dive` / `Hydro Pump`; Tinkaton charged moves are `Gigaton Hammer` / `Play Rough` / `Bulldoze` / `Heavy Slam` / `Flash Cannon`; Kyogre fast move is only `Waterfall`; Melmetal fast move is only `Thunder Shock`).
  - Purged illegal type fallbacks (`Tackle`, `Struggle`, `Frustration`, generic type placeholders) and enforced strict validation against authoritative Gamemaster and curated fallback pools across rankings ingestion, battle rating calculations, and autocomplete suggestions.
- **Dynamic 9x9 Shield Matrix Move-Combo Normalization (`calculateMatchupRatingStatic` & `evaluateDiscreteShieldBattleRating`)**:
  - Replaced hardcoded 5-combo weighting with dynamic alternate combo filtering for Pokémon lacking a 4th charged move, 3rd charged move, or 2nd fast move.
  - The 25% alternate weight is now distributed equally across all valid, distinct alternate combinations that actually exist for the species (`fast1/charge1/charge3`, `fast1/charge1/charge4`, `fast1/charge2/charge3`, `fast1/charge2/charge4`, `fast2/charge1/charge2`). If no alternate combos exist (e.g. single fast move and <= 2 charged moves), 100% of the rating is assigned to the base combo, eliminating skewed weights and duplicate simulation overhead.
- **Team Moveset Optimizer Robustness (`recommendTop3MovesetsForTeamStatic` & `recommendTop3AlternateMovesetsForTeam`)**:
  - Moveset simulation now strictly pairs legal charged moves ($\binom{N}{2}$ combinations or single pair if $N \le 1$) and evaluates only legal fast moves, preventing phantom recommendations for constrained-move Pokémon.

## [v3.15] — 2026-10-22 — Weighted Move-Combo 9x9 Shield Matrix Math (75% Default + 25% Alternate Combos) & Team Moveset Optimizer (Best 3 Alternate Movesets)
- **Weighted Move-Combo 9x9 Shield Matrix Math (`calculateMatchupRatingStatic` & `evaluateDiscreteShieldBattleRating`)**:
  - Updated all 9 shield conditions (`0v0`, `0v1`, `0v2`, `1v0`, `1v1`, `1v2`, `2v0`, `2v1`, `2v2`) to simulate and compute a weighted average across opponent PvPoke move combinations:
    - **1a (`75%` weight)**: Default PvPoke moveset (`fast1 / charge1 / charge2`).
    - **1b (`25%` weight split equally = `5%` each)**: Alternate PvPoke move combinations (`fast1 / charge1 / charge3`, `fast1 / charge1 / charge4`, `fast1 / charge2 / charge3`, `fast1 / charge2 / charge4`, and `fast2 / charge1 / charge2`).
  - Unified live overlay win/loss/neutral determination (`SW`, `W`, `N`, `L`, `SL` in `calculate3v3Matrix` and `calculateShieldMatrix`) and all team-building / battle-quality `0–1000` (`500` neutral) Battle Rating (`BR`) calculations to use the new weighted move-combo math.
- **Current Team Moveset Optimizer (`🎯 Simulate Moves & Propose Best 3 Alternate Movesets`)**:
  - Added a new button to the Team Edit page/dialog (Android & Web) right alongside the Role Upgrades button that keeps your current 3 Pokémon fixed, simulates all legal Fast + Charged move combinations for your team against the blended meta, and proposes the **Best 3 Alternate Movesets** (per slot and top 3 overall) with exact **Team Rating (`Core BR` & `Lead Agg BR` deltas)** and **Positional Ranking (`Lead BR`, `Safe Swap BR`, `Closer BR` deltas)** plus one-tap apply buttons.

## [v3.14] — 2026-10-22 — Single-Screen Scanner Mode Unmasked Capture, Best-Match-Across-Team Player Switch OCR & Single-Tap Stop Overlay Button Fix
- **Single-Screen Scanner Mode Unmasked Capture (`captureAndProcessBattleRegions`)**:
  - Removed all black-rectangle screen masking (`overlayView` and `statusToastView`) and overlay chip-bar filtering so single-screen (single-app) scanner mode never masks out Pokémon GO HUD or move button pixels underneath the floating overlay or status toasts.
- **Best-Match-Across-Team Player Switch OCR (`scoreTeamMemberOnLine` & `handlePlayerSwitchLines`)**:
  - Replaced sequential slot-order matching (which checked Slot 0 / Lead first and immediately returned on any fuzzy edit-distance-2 or shared-CP match such as `Tinkaton` 2499 & `Swampert` 2499) with simultaneous scoring across all 3 team Pokémon to select the strictly best match (`score 0` exact/confusable-normalized > `score 1` 1-edit/5+ char prefix > `score 2` 2-edit) regardless of team order (`Tinkaton / Mimikyu / Swampert` or `Swampert / Mimikyu / Tinkaton`).
  - Added High-Contrast B&W nameplate extraction (`createHighContrastWhiteTextBitmap`) for the top-left player nameplate (`srcPlayer`) alongside 5-variant OCR confusable normalization (`rn -> m`, `1 -> i/l`, `0 -> o`, `v -> y`, `vv -> w`) so `"Swarnpert"` normalizes directly to `"swampert"` (exact match, score `0`).
  - Updated CP and bottom Charged Move button fallbacks to require a strictly unique match across all 3 team members so shared CPs (`2499`) or shared moves never default to Slot 0 (Lead).
- **Single-Tap "Stop Battle Overlay" Button Restoration (`MainActivity` & `OverlayService`)**:
  - Fixed `stopOverlayService()` where `syncOverlayRunningUiState()` read `OverlayService.isInstanceRunning` before the asynchronous stop intent was processed, requiring two taps on **Stop Battle Overlay** to restore **Start Battle Overlay**.

## [v3.13] — 2026-10-22 — Best-Match-Across-Team Player Switch OCR Fix & Single-Tap Stop Overlay Button Fix
- **Best-Match-Across-Team Player Switch OCR (`scoreTeamMemberOnLine` & `handlePlayerSwitchLines`)**:
  - Replaced sequential slot-order matching (which checked Slot 0 / Lead first and immediately returned on any fuzzy edit-distance-2 or shared-CP match) with simultaneous scoring across all 3 team Pokémon to select the strictly best match (`score 0` exact/confusable-normalized > `score 1` 1-edit/7+ char prefix > `score 2` 2-edit) regardless of team order (`Tinkaton / Mimikyu / Swampert` or `Swampert / Mimikyu / Tinkaton`).
  - Added High-Contrast B&W nameplate extraction (`createHighContrastWhiteTextBitmap`) for the top-left player nameplate (`srcPlayer`) alongside 5-variant OCR confusable normalization (`rn -> m`, `1 -> i/l`, `0 -> o`, `v -> y`, `vv -> w`) so `"Swarnpert"` normalizes directly to `"swampert"` (exact match, score `0`).
  - Added horizontal team-chip-bar rejection and length guards so 6-character overlay team chips (`Tinkat`, `Mimiky`, `Swampe`) or shared default CPs (`1500` / `2500`) never pull the active Pokémon back to Slot 0 (Lead).
  - Updated bottom Charged Move button fallback to require a strictly unique best score across all 3 team members (`bestScore >= 3 && bestScore > secondBestScore`) so shared moves (e.g., `Play Rough`) or ties never default to Lead.
- **Single-Tap "Stop Battle Overlay" Button Restoration (`MainActivity` & `OverlayService`)**:
  - Fixed `stopOverlayService()` where `syncOverlayRunningUiState()` read `OverlayService.isInstanceRunning` before the asynchronous stop intent was processed, requiring two taps on **Stop Battle Overlay** to restore **Start Battle Overlay**.

## [v3.12] — 2026-10-21 — Top-5 Role Upgrades (Top-200 Candidates vs. Top-100 Meta), Core Coverage BR (Core BR), Enhanced Mimikyu 2-Strategy Disguise Math & Aegislash Shield/Sword Energy + Damage Shift
- **Top-5 Role Upgrade Recommendations (`Top-200` Candidate Pool vs. `Top-100` Blended Meta)**:
  - Expanded role upgrade recommendations in both the Android and Web Team Editors to display the **Top 5 distinct-species alternatives per role** (`#1 Lead`, `#2 Safe Swap`, `#3 Closer`) with one-tap replacement chips.
  - Increased candidate simulation depth to the **Top 200 Meta Pokémon** for the active league (including eligible Shadow variants and enforcing the GBL species clause) evaluated against the **Top 100** blended current-season meta distribution.
- **Renamed `Mach BR` (`Machine Aggregate BR`) → `Core BR` (`Core Coverage BR`)**:
  - Renamed unclear `Mach BR` / `Machine Aggregate BR` labels to **`Core BR`** / **`Core Coverage BR (Core BR — 3-Mon Team Ceiling)`** across all team preset cards, Team Editor badges, role upgrade chips, and Settings threshold scales while preserving backward-compatible preference keys.
- **Enhanced Mimikyu `Disguise` Simulation (Two-Strategy Shield Ordering Average + Opponent Fastest Charged Move Baiting)**:
  - Updated Mimikyu's discrete shield battle rating math (`0v0` through `2v2`) to compute the exact average of **(a) using all Protect Shields before busting Disguise** (preserving `100%` Defense longer) and **(b) busting Disguise first before using Protect Shields** (absorbing the first throw for `0 HP` and dropping to Busted Form `-1 Defense` stage / `1.20x` incoming damage).
  - Models intelligent opponent baiting: while Mimikyu's Disguise is intact, the opponent always throws their **fastest (lowest-energy) Charged Attack** knowing it will be negated by either a Protect Shield or Disguise.
- **Enhanced Aegislash `Stance Change` Simulation (Shield ⇄ Sword Forme Damage AND Energy Generation Shift)**:
  - Explicitly models the shift in **both Fast/Charged Move damage AND Fast Move energy generation** between **Shield Forme** (`97 Atk / 291 Def`, `1 HP` fast damage, boosted `1.28x` high energy generation) and **Sword/Blade Forme** (`291 Atk / 97 Def`, full `291 Atk` fast & charged damage, `0.78x` lower energy generation rate and `97 Def` vulnerability until reverting to Shield Forme via a Protect Shield).

## [v3.11] — 2026-10-21 — Top-100 Role Upgrade Recommendations, Unique Ability Battle Ranking Math (Morpeko / Mimikyu / Aegislash / Cramorant), ABB/ABC Auto-Detection & Position-Weighted Shield Ratings
- **Top-100 Role Upgrade Recommendation Engine (`#1 Lead`, `#2 Safe Swap`, `#3 Closer`)**:
  - Added an on-demand **`✨ Suggest Top-100 Role Upgrades (3 Per Role)`** button inside the Create Team and Edit Team dialogs (Android & Web) with **3 one-tap replacement chips** beneath Slot 1, Slot 2, and Slot 3.
  - Simulates the **Top 100 Meta Pokémon** for the selected league (including eligible Shadow variants) against your blended current-season meta distribution while enforcing the **GBL species clause** (no duplicate base species across your 3 slots and at most 1 Mega in Mega Master League).
  - Ranks candidates for each slot by combining **Full Team Synergy (`ΔTeamMachBR`)** and **Role Rating Delta (`ΔRoleBR`)** plus defensive coverage bonuses ($0.55 \cdot \Delta\text{MachBR} + 0.45 \cdot \Delta\text{RoleBR} + \text{CoverageBonus}$), and immediately populates the Pokémon, PvPoke recommended moveset, CP, and updated team ratings on a single tap.
- **Unique Form-Change & Signature Ability Battle Ranking Math (`Morpeko`, `Mimikyu`, `Aegislash`, `Cramorant`)**:
  - **Morpeko (`Hunger Switch` + `Aura Wheel`)**: Models alternating Full Belly (Electric) and Hangry (Dark) STAB `Aura Wheel` cycles with its guaranteed `+1 Attack` stage self-buff (`1.25x` compounding up to `+4` stages / `2.0x`) across every charged move cycle.
  - **Mimikyu (`Disguise`)**: Models the intact Disguise absorbing the first unshielded incoming Charged Attack for `1 HP` (acting as a free extra shield in 0s/1s/2s scenarios), followed by the Busted Form `-1 Defense` stage drop (`0.8x` Defense multiplier).
  - **Aegislash (`Stance Change: Shield Forme ⇄ Blade Forme`)**: Models Shield Forme (`97 Atk / 291 Def`) tanking incoming damage while generating energy with 1-damage fast moves, transforming into Blade Forme (`291 Atk / 97 Def`, ~`2.98x` Attack) right before executing Charged Attacks (`Shadow Ball` / `Flash Cannon` / `Gyro Ball`), and reverting to Shield Forme when spending a Protect Shield.
  - **Cramorant (`Gulp Missile: Gulping / Gorging Form`)**: Models `Surf` loading Arrokuda (`> 50% HP`) or Pikachu (`≤ 50% HP`), dealing automatic `12.5%` max-HP retaliation counter-damage when attacked and inflicting a guaranteed `-1 Defense` stage drop (`0.8x` Defense) in Gulping Form or `-1 Attack` stage drop (`0.8x` Attack) in Gorging Form.
- **Non-Blocking Background Evaluation & Instant Team Switching**:
  - Eliminated UI thread stalls and redundant recalculation loops when switching teams or editing presets by moving heavy team evaluation and Top-100 recommendation simulations onto background worker threads (`Dispatchers.Default`) and memoizing per-preset battle rating metrics.
  - Restricted manual slot reordering buttons (`#1 ⇄ #2`, `#2 ⇄ #3`) and `⚡ Auto-Detect Style & Order Swap` exclusively to the **Team Editor** modal so the main Team Select screen stays fast and uncluttered.
- **Auto Team Style Classification (`ABB` vs. `ABC`) & Smart Slot Reordering**:
  - Evaluates pairwise defensive type vulnerabilities across all 3 team members and tests whether the candidate Lead resists shared backline weaknesses (`≥ 2` shared weaknesses or `1` critical meta weakness):
    - **`ABB` Lineups**: Automatically moves the resisting `A` Pokémon to **Slot 1 (Lead)**, places the higher bait-pressure / faster energy `B` Pokémon into **Slot 2 (`Bait Swap B1`)**, and places the higher closing-power `B` Pokémon into **Slot 3 (`Sweeper B2`)**.
    - **`ABC` Lineups**: Keeps **Slot 1 (Lead)** fixed, places the backline Pokémon with the highest volatility-adjusted `Swap BR` ($\mu - 0.5\sigma$) into **Slot 2 (`Safe Swap`)**, and places the remaining Pokémon into **Slot 3 (`Closer`)**.
- **Current-Season Blended Meta & Exponential Recency Decay (`0–50` Match Ramp)**:
  - Calculates expected opponent probability distributions $P_{\text{lead}}(p)$ (from opponent leads) and $P_{\text{field}}(p)$ (from all 3 opponent Pokémon) strictly from **current GBL season** battle logs blended with active league PvPoke rankings.
  - Scales historical battle log weight linearly from `0%` at `0` matches up to `70%` at `50+` current-season matches ($w_{\text{hist}} = 0.70 \times \min(1, N / 50)$, $w_{\text{meta}} = 1 - w_{\text{hist}}$) and weights more recent logs exponentially higher ($W(k) = e^{-0.05 \cdot (k - 1)}$).
- **Position-Weighted Shield Scenario Ratings & Per-Slot Battle Rating Badges**:
  - **Slot 1 (`Lead`)**: $0.50 \cdot BR_{2v2} + 0.50 \cdot BR_{1v1}$ (`Lead Agg BR` color-coded by `SW / W / N / L / SL` thresholds).
  - **Slot 2 (`Safe Swap / Pivot`)**: $0.60 \cdot BR_{1v1} + 0.25 \cdot BR_{2v1} + 0.15 \cdot BR_{1v0}$ with volatility penalty $\mu_{\text{Swap}} - 0.5\sigma_{\text{Swap}}$.
  - **Slot 3 (`Closer / Sweeper`)**: $0.60 \cdot BR_{0v0} + 0.25 \cdot BR_{1v0} + 0.15 \cdot BR_{0v1}$, plus side-by-side **Swap BR** badges on both Slot 2 and Slot 3 and customizable **Machine Aggregate BR (`Mach BR`)** 5-tier thresholds in **⚙️ Settings**.
