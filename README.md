## Advanced Analytics & Quality Metrics (v3.00)

Raw win rate in GO Battle League is heavily influenced by matchmaking alignment and blind 3v3 team-composition luck (RPS). **SilphScope PvP v3.00** separates **Matchup Luck (Blind Matchup Favorability — BMF)** from **Dynamic Execution WAE (Wins Above Expected)** so you can track both matchmaking favorability and your in-battle micro-execution skill (energy farming, fast move denial, sacrificial catches, shield discipline, and CMP timing).

### 1. Asymmetric Shield Matrix Evaluation ($0\text{v}0$ through $2\text{v}2$)

For any active head-to-head pairing $(\text{userActive}, \text{oppActive})$, `evaluatePvPokeMatchupRating(myMon, oppMon, sUser, sOpp, league)` computes a PvPoke-calibrated $0\text{–}1000$ battle rating ($500 = \text{Neutral}$, $>500 = \text{Favorable}$, $<500 = \text{Negative}$) across all **9 discrete shield permutations** $(s_{\text{user}}, s_{\text{opp}}) \in \{0, 1, 2\}^2$:

$$\mathcal{S} = \{0\text{v}0,\; 0\text{v}1,\; 0\text{v}2,\; 1\text{v}0,\; 1\text{v}1,\; 1\text{v}2,\; 2\text{v}0,\; 2\text{v}1,\; 2\text{v}2\}$$

Each state models unblocked charged-move pressure against the defender's remaining shields ($s_{\text{def}} \in \{0, 1, 2\}$), fast-move effectiveness weighted by average shield depth, Shadow bulk adjustments, and a direct asymmetric shield-advantage delta when $s_{\text{user}} \neq s_{\text{opp}}$.

### 2. Blind Matchup Favorability ($M = 0.40 \cdot S_{\text{lead}} + 0.60 \cdot S_{\text{back}}$)

**Blind Matchup Favorability (BMF / $P_{\text{pre}}$)** measures pre-match 3v3 lineup favorability before any swaps, catches, or baits occur:

- **Lead Score ($S_{\text{lead}}$ — $50/50$ $1\text{v}1$ & $2\text{v}2$ Split)**:
  Blends the symmetric $1\text{v}1$ and $2\text{v}2$ shield scenarios equally to prevent bait-tree distortions and reflect standard lead gameplay:
  $$S_{\text{lead}} = 0.50 \cdot \text{Rating}_{1\text{v}1}(\text{myLead}, \text{oppLead}) + 0.50 \cdot \text{Rating}_{2\text{v}2}(\text{myLead}, \text{oppLead})$$
- **Backline Score ($S_{\text{back}}$ — $70/30$ Optimal Alignment Weighting)**:
  Evaluates the two possible $1\text{v}1$ backline pairings ($\text{Score}_A$ and $\text{Score}_B$) and weights the stronger alignment at $70\%$ and the weaker alignment at $30\%$:
  $$S_{\text{back}} = 0.70 \cdot \max(\text{Score}_A, \text{Score}_B) + 0.30 \cdot \min(\text{Score}_A, \text{Score}_B)$$
- **Composite Score ($M$) & Logistic Pre-Match Win Probability ($P_{\text{pre}}$ / Matchup Luck)**:
  $$M = 0.40 \cdot S_{\text{lead}} + 0.60 \cdot S_{\text{back}}, \qquad P_{\text{pre}} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-0.006 \cdot (M - 500)}}$$
- **Aggregate Matchup Luck**:
  $$\text{Matchup Luck} = \frac{\sum_{i \in \text{Filtered}} w_i \cdot P_{\text{pre}, i}}{\sum_{i \in \text{Filtered}} w_i} \times 100\%$$

### 3. Dynamic Execution WAE with Timeline Duration Weighting ($\sum \tau_k \cdot R_k$)

When a match has recorded timeline events (`SWAP`, `SHIELD`, `FAINT`), `calculateDynamicExecutionWAE` partitions the battle into active head-to-head intervals $k$ bounded by swap and faint timestamps:

- **Duration-Weighted Execution Rating ($S_{\text{actual}}$)**:
  For each interval $k$ with duration $\Delta t_k$ and fractional weight $\tau_k = \frac{\Delta t_k}{t_{\text{total}}}$, the engine resolves the asymmetric shield rating $R_k = \text{Rating}_{s_{\text{user},k}\text{v}s_{\text{opp},k}}(\text{userActive}_k, \text{oppActive}_k)$ using the live shield counts at that moment:
  $$S_{\text{actual}} = \sum_{k} \tau_k \cdot R_k, \qquad P_{\text{exec}} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-0.006 \cdot (S_{\text{actual}} - 500)}}$$
  *(If timeline events are absent, such as manual or legacy entries, $P_{\text{exec}}$ gracefully falls back to $P_{\text{pre}}$.)*
- **Base Execution Residual ($\Delta Q_{\text{base}}$)**:
  $$\Delta Q_{\text{base}} = \text{Result} - P_{\text{exec}}, \qquad \text{Result} \in \{0.0, 1.0\}$$
- **Faint Margin Scaling ($\times 1.10$)**:
  If $\text{Result} = 1.0$ and $(\text{oppFaints} - \text{userFaints}) \ge 2$, positive execution credit is scaled by $1.10\times$:
  $$\Delta Q_{\text{scaled}} = 1.10 \cdot \Delta Q_{\text{base}}$$
- **Shield-in-Pocket Penalty ($-0.15$ per unused shield)**:
  If $\text{Result} = 0.0$ and $\text{userShieldsRemaining} > 0$, unspent defensive resources are penalized:
  $$\Delta Q_{\text{final}} = \Delta Q_{\text{scaled}} - 0.15 \cdot \text{userShieldsRemaining}$$
- **Aggregate Execution WAE**:
  $$\text{EXEC WAE} = \frac{\sum_{i \in \text{Filtered}} w_i \cdot \Delta Q_{\text{final}, i}}{\sum_{i \in \text{Filtered}} w_i} \times 100\%$$

### 4. Handling of Unrevealed Pokémon (Early Forfeits & Sweeps)

| Opponent Lineup Seen | Confidence Weight ($w$) | Evaluation Behavior |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Missing 2nd Slot (`firstSwap` null/missing)** | $w = 0.00$ | **Dropped / Unranked (`quality: null`)**: Early forfeits or incomplete scans where the opponent's switch was never revealed are excluded from ranked `EXEC WAE` and `MATCHUP LUCK`. |
| **Unrevealed 3rd Slot (`finalSeen` null/missing)** | $w = 0.75$ | **75% Confidence Meta-Prior (`⚡ 75% Conf`)**: Substitutes the unweighted average $1\text{v}1$ ratings of `mySwap` ($\bar{R}_{\text{swap}}$) and `myClose` ($\bar{R}_{\text{close}}$) against the active league's top meta pool: $\text{Score}_A = \frac{R_{1\text{v}1}(\text{mySwap}, \text{oppSwap}) + \bar{R}_{\text{close}}}{2}$, $\text{Score}_B = \frac{R_{1\text{v}1}(\text{myClose}, \text{oppSwap}) + \bar{R}_{\text{swap}}}{2}$. |
| **All 3 Opponents Revealed** | $w = 1.00$ | **Full 3v3 Evaluation**: Exact pairwise $1\text{v}1$ backline matrix evaluation at $100\%$ confidence weight. |

### 5. Badge Glossary (6 Primary Performance Badges & 5 Contextual Event Pills)

Primary performance badges are derived from Pre-Match BMF ($P_{\text{pre}}$) and the match outcome, accompanied by contextual timeline/end-state pills:

| Outcome | Pre-Match BMF ($P_{\text{pre}}$) | Primary Badge | Color Hex | Tactical Meaning |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **WIN** | $P_{\text{pre}} < 0.40$ | **`Clutch Win`** | Cyan `#22d3ee` | Flipped a heavily unfavorable team alignment via superior micro-execution (catches, energy lead, or shield baiting). |
| **WIN** | $0.40 \le P_{\text{pre}} \le 0.60$ | **`Skill Win`** | Bright Green `#4ade80` | Out-executed the opponent in an even/neutral 3v3 matchup. |
| **WIN** | $P_{\text{pre}} > 0.60$ | **`Expected Win`** | Muted Slate `#94a3b8` | Cleanly converted a favorable team-composition advantage into a win. |
| **LOSS** | $P_{\text{pre}} > 0.60$ | **`Blunder Loss`** | Rose Red `#f43f5e` | Dropped a favorable matchup where your 3v3 lineup had $>60\%$ pre-match win equity. |
| **LOSS** | $0.40 \le P_{\text{pre}} \le 0.60$ | **`Tough Loss`** | Orange `#fb923c` | Narrow loss in a competitive 50/50 matchup. |
| **LOSS** | $P_{\text{pre}} < 0.40$ | **`Expected Loss`** | Muted Slate `#94a3b8` | Hard-countered team composition ($<40\%$ win equity); minimal negative impact on WAE. |

**Contextual Event Pills**:
- **`⚠️ Double Shield Pocket`**: Loss with 2 unused shields remaining ($-0.30$ $\Delta Q$ penalty).
- **`⚠️ Shield in Pocket`**: Loss with 1 unused shield remaining ($-0.15$ $\Delta Q$ penalty).
- **`🧹 Clean Sweep`**: Win achieved with 0 user faints (all 3 Pokémon surviving).
- **`🛡️ Shield Advantage`**: Win ending with more shields remaining than the opponent.
- **`⚡ 75% Conf`**: Opponent's 3rd Pokémon was unrevealed; evaluated at $w = 0.75$ confidence weight using the league meta-average prior.
